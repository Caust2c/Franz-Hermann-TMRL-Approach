# Franz-Hermann-TMRL-Approach
A more guided approach at Trackmania AI and a real life application using Particle Swarm Optimization

This project was initally intended to be done with a real-life RC Car churning out the best lap times, however due to a lack of LIDAR sensor i had to shift to a game based implementation.

The project includes:
- 📍 Path extraction and geometry analysis (adapted from Trackmania map data)
- 🧠 Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for finding the optimal racing trajectory
- 🎮 Simulation in Trackmania for visual and analytical feedback

I have essentially combined two repositories for this task with some changes and additions.

- [TrackMania_AI](https://github.com/AndrejGobeX/TrackMania_AI) (GPLv3)
- [Racing-Line-Optimization-with-PSO](https://github.com/ParsaD23/Racing-Line-Optimization-with-PSO) (MIT)

As such, this project is licensed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE).

As for the name, “Franz Hermann” was an alias used by Max Verstappen during a GT3 test at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, part of the official Nürburgring Endurance Series (he did it to avoid media attention). Hence, the name was given to the repo as admiration as the admired as one of the fastest, arguably greatest racing driver in F1 history.
