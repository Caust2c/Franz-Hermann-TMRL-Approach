# Franz-Hermann-TMRL-Approach
A more guided approach at Trackmania AI and a real life application using Particle Swarm Optimization

This project was initally intended to be done with a real-life RC Car churning out the best lap times, however due to a lack of LIDAR sensor i had to shift to a game based implementation.

The project includes:
- üìç Path extraction and geometry analysis (adapted from Trackmania map data)
- üß† Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for finding the optimal racing trajectory
- üéÆ Simulation in Trackmania for visual and analytical feedback

I have essentially combined two repositories for this task with some changes and additions.

- [TrackMania_AI](https://github.com/AndrejGobeX/TrackMania_AI) (GPLv3)
- [Racing-Line-Optimization-with-PSO](https://github.com/ParsaD23/Racing-Line-Optimization-with-PSO) (MIT)

As such, this project is licensed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE).
